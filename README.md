# 📘 2nd Semester C Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs created during my 2nd semester. These programs cover a wide range of fundamental concepts in C programming, such as control structures, searching and sorting algorithms, mathematical operations, and file handling.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder contains a C file focused on a specific concept or program:

- `array` – Basic array operations
- `binary_search` – Binary search implementation
- `Bubble sort` – Bubble sort algorithm
- `factorial` – Program to calculate factorial of a number
- `file_program` – File input/output operations
- `gcd_using_euclids` – GCD calculation using Euclid’s algorithm
- `greatest_of_2_conditional` – Find the greater number using conditional operator
- `hello_world` – The classic first C program
- `largest_of_2` – Program to find the largest of two numbers
- `linear_search` – Linear search implementation
- `mean_variance_stddev` – Statistical calculations
- `multi_of_matrix` – Matrix multiplication
- `palindrome` – Check whether a number/string is a palindrome
- `prime_nos_in_range` – Display prime numbers in a given range
- `roots_of_quad_eqn` – Solve a quadratic equation
- `selection_sort` – Selection sort algorithm
- `student_details` – Store and display student information using structures
- `sum_and_occurrence` – Sum and count occurrence of numbers
- `sum_diff_prod_quot` – Basic arithmetic operations
- `transpose_of_matrix` – Transpose of a matrix

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2nd-sem-c-programs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to any folder and compile the `.c` file using GCC  
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
